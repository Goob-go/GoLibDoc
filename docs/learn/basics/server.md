# Server
With it, you can synchronize data between the server and the client
::: info WHAT YOU'LL LEARN
⚫How to create a server

⚫How to create a client

⚫How to sync your data
:::

## Creating a shared server
```luau
local server = GoLib.net.createServer{
	id = "SharedData",
	data = {
		difficulty = 1,
	},
}
server.defaultDataAccess.read = 0
```
Table in field data will be synced to all clients which have access

To start synchronization you need call start method
```luau
server:start()
```
To stop synchronization you need call stop method
```luau
server:stop()
```
::: warning
defaultDataAccess by default is
```luau
{
    read = 1;
    write = math.huge
}
```
**Player lvl by default is 0**

This means that to make data for public, you need to set the default level to 0
```luau
server.defaultDataAccess.read = 0
```
    
:::



### Client
```luau
local client = GoLib.net.createClient("SharedData")

client.onHydrate:Wait()

print(client.data:get())
```
**Output**
```luau
{
    ["difficulty"] = 1
}
```
client.onHydrate:Wait() waiting for the date

## Creating player data

```luau
local server = GoLib.net.createServer{
	id = plr.UserId,
	data = {
		coins = GoLib.create(0),
		health = GoLib.create(100),
	},
    interval = .05 -- waits .05 second and collecting data before sending
}

server.players[plr] = 1 -- our player has level 1 access

server.dataAccess.health = {
	read = 0
} -- level 0 is required for access for health

server:start()
```
### Our client
```luau
local client = GoLib.net.createClient(Players.LocalPlayer.UserId)

client.onHydrate:Wait()

print(client.data:get())
```
**Output**
```luau
{
    ["coins"] = 0,
    ["health"] = 100
}
```
### Other clients
```luau
local client = GoLib.net.createClient(userId)

client.onHydrate:Wait()

print(client.data:get())
```
**Output**
```luau
{
    ["health"] = 100
}
```
::: danger
If you create a client not for your player, you will need to dispose of it yourself, if necessary, with help **destroy()** method
:::
## More complex
```luau
local server = GoLib.net.createServer{
	id = "Group1",
	data = {
		name = "Ice",
		status = GoLib.createTable({
			[plr1] = "Sleeping",
			[plr2] = "Working"
		})
	},
}

server.players[plr1] = 1
server.players[plr2] = 1

server.dataAccess.name = {
	read = 0
}
server.dataAccess.status = {
	write = 1,
	individual = true,
    validation = function(_,value)
		return type(value) == "string"
	end,
}
server:start()
```
###  Plr1 client 
**Output**
```luau
{
    name = "Ice",
    status = "Sleeping",
}
```
###  Plr2 client 
**Output**
```luau
{
    name = "Ice",
    status = "Working",
}
```
### Other clients
**Output**
```luau
{
    name = "Ice"
}
```

## DataAccess field
Here you customize how your field will behave
### Example
```luau
server.dataAccess.status = {
    read = 1,
    write = 1,
    individual = true, -- the player will have only the value that is assigned to him in the table. Example server : status = {[plr]=true} / client : status = true
    validation = function(plr,value) -- plr is who want to change
        return type(value) == "string"
    end) -- if it returns false, the value will not be assigned
}
```
#### read
Player need level 1 to see this field
#### write
Player need level 1 to change this value from client
#### individual
Player will have only the value that is assigned to him in the table. 
##### Example 
```luau
server : status = {[plr]=true}
client : status = true
```
### validation
Сalled when someone from the client wants to change the value.

if it returns false, the value will not be assigned

## Players field
This determines the player's access level
```luau
server.players[plr1] = 1
server.players[plr2] = 2
```
## More control for server
You can write your own logic for synchronization using replicator and onRequestState
### OnRequestState
Called when the player wants to get the state(data)
```luau
function server:onRequestState(plr)
    -- your logic
end
```
### Replicator
Called when the server wants to send data to the client about changing a field
```luau
server.replicator = function(plr,id,flags,data)
    -- your logic
end
```
### Hydrate
sets the current state to the client is also needed when writing custom logic for onRequestState
```luau
server:hydrate(plr)
```
